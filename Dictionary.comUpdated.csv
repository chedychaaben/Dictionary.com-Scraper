Astrology fans who do consider Ophiuchus to be the 13th sign of the zodiac may consider people whose birthday falls within this time period to have Ophiuchus as their sign.

The Google, Samsung, Twitter, and Facebook versions of the emoji have the bottom of the ship emitting a tractor beam. UFOs, also often referred to as flying saucers, are commonly depicted in popular culture as the spacecraft used by aliens from outer space. For this reason, the UFO emoji 🛸 is often used with the Alien emoji 👽 to discuss fictional space aliens or to question their existence in real life. More generally, the UFO emoji 🛸 is used with other outer space-themed emoji, such as the Rocket emoji 🚀 or the Ringed Planet emoji 🪐, to discuss outer space or astronomy. The term UFO dates back to the 1950s, when aviator Daniel Keyhoe used it in a book. In May 2021, the UFO emoji 🛸 saw increased usage on social media after it was revealed that the United States government was completing a report on “unidentified aerial phenomena.” While government officials avoided providing more details, some in the media and the public concluded that the government was investigating the existence of alien spacecraft.

The Wine emoji 🍷 is commonly used to refer to actual wine and is used when speaking metaphorically about wine, as in the phrases “wine and dine” and “age like a fine wine.” Because wine is often stereotypically thought of as a drink for the wealthy or elite, the Wine emoji 🍷 is often used to refer to glamorous or luxurious things, such as fancy restaurants or expensive homes. In a related sense, the Wine emoji 🍷 is used to talk about romantic dinners or dates. This is a reference to candlelight dinners (where wine is usually served).","The Wine emoji 🍷is used to refer to actual and metaphorical mentions of wine. Too much wine last night.

66,gemini-emoji,♊, Gemini emoji,"The Gemini emoji ♊ depicts the sign of Gemini, a constellation and one of the twelve zodiac signs in astrology. It is commonly used to represent Gemini, people whose zodiac sign is Gemini, and astrology in general. According to astrology, people who were born between May 21 and June 20 have Gemini as their sign. For this reason, you are more likely to see the Gemini emoji ♊ used during this time as people celebrate their birthdays.  Gemini is also commonly known as The Twins (Gemini is the Latin word for twins) and the Gemini emoji ♊ usually depicts the symbol of Gemini, which is the Roman numeral II referring to two people (who are twins).","The Gemini emoji ♊ was approved under Unicode 1.1 in 1993. On most major platforms, the emoji resembles the symbol of Gemini (a glyph that resembles the Roman numeral II) colored white imposed on a geometric shape. On Apple, Samsung, WhatsApp, Twitter, and Facebook, the Gemini symbol is on a purple square with rounded corners. On Microsoft, the purple square has sharp corners and is surrounded by a black outline. On Google, the Gemini symbol is instead on an orange circle.  On Twitter, many people put the emoji representing their star sign next to their usernames in order to identify themselves. As is the case with all of the other zodiac signs, this is also true for the Gemini emoji ♊.   When the Gemini emoji ♊ is used, it is often accompanied by the word Gemini itself. This is likely done to help identify what the symbol means, as it may not be familiar even to fans of astrology. Gemini is commonly known as The Twins, and so the Gemini emoji ♊ is sometimes used with the Two Men Holding Hands emoji 👬 and Two Women Holding Hands emoji 👭 (which are used to represent twin siblings).   If you are a Gemini, you can check out the words that every Gemini should know so you can use the Gemini emoji ♊ to let everyone know how great it is to be a Gemini!","The Gemini emoji ♊ is used by people with an interest in astrology.

The beef patty (usually pan fried or cooked on a grill and then topped with lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and condiments like mayonnaise or ketchup) is believed to ultimately come from Hamburg, Germany. First, in 1758, the “Hamburgh sausage” appeared, a sausage served on warm bread, and later, in the mid-1800s, roasted beefsteak appeared on a warm bread roll. The first American version of a hamburger may have been served by Louis Lassen of Louis’ Lunch in 1900 in New Haven, Connecticut. There are a few other claims that put the burger on American plates slightly earlier than 1900. The first hamburger chain restaurant? White Castle. And the first McDonald’s location opened in California, way back in 1940. The Hamburger emoji 🍔 was approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010. Despite the emoji’s official name, most major platforms depict a classic cheeseburger on sesame buns with lettuce and tomato. The layering of those toppings has been subject to some popular controversy. An early Google version once had the cheese underneath the patty; it was corrected after the internet chastised Google for getting it wrong. Apple and WhatsApp place the lettuce under the patty.","Of course, the simple hamburger is one of America’s favorite foods, especially when you’re in a hurry or need something pretty portable to eat on the go.

On others, such as Google and Facebook, she is a brunette. Her default form has an ethnically neutral yellow face, though users can select different skin tones to change the color of her face and hair for their desired representation. Don’t confuse her with the Girl emoji, which looks like the Woman emoji 👩 but with the hair pulled into pigtails: 👧. While the Woman emoji 👩 is available as a stand-alone emoji, programmers have paired her code with other emoji to create a wide range of female forms of existing emoji, from the Woman Farmer 👩‍🌾 to Woman Golfing 🏌️‍♀️ emoji. For instance, the Woman Mechanic emoji 👩‍🔧 is a combination of of the Woman emoji 👩 and the Wrench emoji 🔧, which many platforms have morphed into a single emoji. This emoji magic extends to depictions of families and relationships, providing greater diversity than the traditional mother-father or husband-wife configurations.

135,skull-emoji,💀, Skull emoji,"The Skull emoji 💀 shows a simple skull, not to be confused with the Skull and Crossbones ☠️ emoji … that one is completely different, of course. The black cavities of the Skull emoji 💀, where the eyes would be, are enormous, and the inclusion of teeth varies from platform to platform. It’s mostly used in lighthearted posts related to death or scary things.","The Skull emoji 💀 was approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015. The difference between the Skull emoji 💀 and the Skull and Crossbones ☠️ emoji is the tone, mainly. The Skull and Crossbones ☠️ emoji conveys poison and death, quite literally: it’s often the symbol to indicate poison on a product. Meanwhile, the Skull emoji 💀 has a more fun feel … even though it still can be used when talking about death. The human skull has long been associated with death and creepy things. Being an easily identified part of a skeleton, it’s the part of the body that conveys the deepest representational meaning of life, both past and present. During the Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) holiday traditions, in which late loved ones are remembered, the skull is an omnipresent symbol, represented in sugary treats and colorful art. While looking death right in the face (or what’s left of it) should be scary, the bejeweled, bedazzled, kaleidoscopic Day of the Dead treatment of the human skull has a way of turning fear into something much easier to manage. Overall, while we associate it with death, the skull has also enjoyed popularity in trendy design, being featured on everything from jewelry to clothing.","The Skull emoji 💀 is not usually used in a serious or dark way, though it’s sometimes used in social media relating to death or the paranormal. More often, it is used in relation to Halloween, to uncertainty, to scary things in life, and to those things which are sure to kill us, like kettlebells or deep embarrassment. Again, remember the Skull and Crossbones ☠️ emoji is used more as a warning, about something dangerous, deadly, or toxic (yes, it can be a person). The simple Skull emoji 💀 mostly pokes fun at death … or alludes to it in a friendly way.

The lizard emoji is green though … and it’s also a quadrupedal lizard (meaning it has four legs) because a “legless lizard” (that’s a thing) would be confusing, and look a lot like a snake.

139,turkey-emoji,🦃, Turkey emoji,"Gobble, gobble! The turkey emoji represents the … well … turkey and serves as a symbol for the American holiday of Thanksgiving. It also can signify non-holiday related feelings of gratitude.","School kids in America are often taught that turkey on Thanksgiving is an American tradition because it’s what the pilgrims shared with the Native Americans to thank them for helping them survive the winter. In truth, the alleged three-day feast shared by the settlers and Wampanoag in 1621 probably featured venison … but that’s a different story. Back to why Americans eat turkey on Thanksgiving … the holiday of Thanksgiving began in 1863 as an effort to unify the country in the throes of the Civil War. Turkey was promoted as a food in order to Americanize immigrants and for practical purposes: one of these beasts can feed a lot of people. Fast forward to 2015 when the turkey emoji entered Unicode as a symbol for the Thanksgiving holiday. It shows a large brown bird, facing left with a red neck, and waddle. It’s in the “animals and nature” sections of emojis since it depicts a live bird, one that could be happily running around in the wild. While there is a chicken drumstick and other food versions of the chicken in Unicode, there is not emoji of a dressed turkey ready for the oven. In 2017, the poultry company Butterball launched a Change.org petition for a dead and plucked version of the bird to be added to emoji language. Poor turkey.

An especially annoyed Apple user posted this on an Apple forum, mistakenly assuming that the creation of emoji was up to Apple: “We need parrot emojis. You guys took our gun so it’s the least you could do. All I want it to be able to put a parrot emoji at the end of a text when I talk about my favorite pet.” After that angry rant … the parrot emoji was approved as part of Unicode 11.0 in 2018 and added to Emoji 11.0 in 2018.

141,tulip-emoji,🌷, Tulip emoji,"A symbol of springtime, the lovely tulip is represented in the emoji world by tulips in various shades of pink and red, with almost every digital platform showing a stem and two long leaves reaching skyward. The Tulip emoji 🌷 is usually used in posts about flowers, beauty, and springtime … though it can be sexual in nature as well (what a surprise).","The Tulip emoji 🌷was approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015. Used in social media wherever beauty, romance, flowers, and gardening themes are prevalent, the Tulip emoji 🌷 also appears in texting on occasion to represent female genitalia due its soft, pink petals. Why? Flowers have long been viewed as being appropriately representative of this part of a woman’s anatomy. The most famous instance is in the work of painter Georgia O’Keeffe, though many critics now dismiss the Freudian theory that O’Keeffe’s flower paintings were intentionally created with vulvas in mind. She always claimed they were not, and the initial theory was put forth by a man, the photographer Alfred Stieglitz, who became her husband … so there’s that. Tulips come in a dazzling array of colors and are beloved for their beautiful symmetry, grace, and ease in growing. Just throw some bulbs in the ground in the fall, and you’re likely to get some tulips in spring! Sadly, the blooms only last for a few days. Tulips are part of the lily family, and all of their colors symbolize things as well: red symbolizes true love, white symbolizes purity and forgiveness, and yellow is all about good wishes, sunshine, and cheeriness. Pink? Pink is about affection, but it’s not as strong an expression of love as red. Tulips are native to central Asia, but migrated to the Netherlands, or Holland, where they became a treasured, precious item during “Tulip mania” in the Dutch Golden Age of the 1600s.

The pistol emoji on most platforms now depicts a toy or water gun, though for a while at least half of the designs depicted a more realistic-looking weapon. Where the use of this emoji at one time might have more serious intent or connotations, now it’s mostly used in more playful ways, though it can also pertain to gun culture (pro and con).","The original pistol emoji was approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015. Original versions appeared on various platforms as a strong representation of a firearm or weapon. In 2016, Apple swapped out their version to a bright green plastic-looking toy gun, and other platforms soon followed suit. Google and Microsoft even added a round water chamber on top of their colorful image, making it appear very much like a water gun. There are a few platforms, like LG and Mozilla, that still show realistic gun images, but those are being phased out.","Since it’s the only gun emoji out there, the pistol emoji does double duty. It can be used in a lighthearted, whimsical way (toys, toy gun sounds, “kill me now,” or “killer good looks” implications, etc.) or it can be used in reference to real firearms.

156,love-you-gesture-emoji,🤟, I Love You Gesture emoji,"A universal emoji! Or … is it? The love-you gesture or I love you hand sign emoji is the American Sign Language gesture for “I love you,” showing a hand with a raised index finger and pinky (little) finger and an extended thumb. It comes in a range of skin tones. It’s used to express affection … but is also used when people are trying to find the sign of the horns 🤘instead (oops).","It seems a natural fit for the Unicode consortium (emoji gatekeepers, for the most part) to embrace American Sign Language signals. The love-you gesture or I love you hand sign emoji was approved for Unicode 10.0 in 2017 and added to Emoji 5.0 in 2017. It came about after a petition by two people, one being Western Oregon University professor C.M. Hall. In 2015, Hall said, “The deaf community being one that is incredibly marginalized and pathologized … When we insert gestures (in emoji), we are already communicating visually, so why not include the most recognized gesture in ASL? I see it as such a simple, yet profound benchmark of dignity.” Perhaps, surprisingly to some, the love-you gesture emoji is commonly used in reference to rock music, due to its similarity to its rock’n’roll cousin, the sign of the horns or rock on emoji. The love-you emoji shows the thumb extended, as it is in American Sign Language, while the sign of the horns emoji depicts the thumb tucked into the hand. They’re so similar that the rock star Gene Simmons of the band KISS attempted to trademark this version, the love-you gesture emoji, as his own take on the rock on emoji. He withdrew his application, mostly due to widespread criticism from other musicians.  Maybe he also withdrew it when he realized it was the wrong symbol … Emojipedia","Browsing social media, you may be struck by the range of uses for the the love-you gesture emoji. It’s used to express affection or intense approval for someone or something, romantic love, and even, yes, a kind of “rock on!” enthusiasm where they could use the more rock’n’roll emoji, the sign of the horns.

It’s mostly used in reference to winter and fall and to those wily squirrels running amok in the yard. Oh, and it also represents some other nuts … the human variety.","Since there is no walnut or pecan emoji, the Chestnut emoji 🌰 gets around in all postings related to nuts (you know what that means). Actually, we should clarify: it is the only tree nut emoji. A peanut emoji does exist, but it’s a different kind of nut that grows underground. Chestnuts, by the way, must be cooked to be eaten.

In many versions, it’s wrapped in foil–”Mission” style, named for the Mission District of San Francisco–which, if you ask us, is hands-down the best way to eat a burrito. As you might imagine, the burrito emoji is mostly used in posts about food. Mostly.","Did you know the word “burrito” translates to “little donkey?” It may be because a burrito faintly resembles bed rolls that donkeys sometimes carry. Though the burrito first appeared in Mexico, by most accounts, sometime in the mid-1800s, the Mesoamerican peoples of Mexico used corn tortillas in 10,000 B.C. to wrap food. In Mexico, the tortillas generally convey bean and meat, and little else, but in the U.S., you might find lettuce, diced tomatoes, guacamole, sour cream, rice, cheese and a number of other items, just to ensure your post-burrito-eating experience makes you feel as full and uncomfortable as possible. In a good way. The burrito emoji kept food good company when it was approved as part of Unicode 8.0 in 2015: it made its debut with the taco, hot dog, popcorn and cheese wedge. The burrito was added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015.","Who doesn’t love Mexican food? We needed the burrito emoji almost as much as we occasionally need the real-life, three-pound, perfectly mobile culinary delight. Of course, the burrito emoji is used in posts related to all kinds of Mexican food and culture. In texting, it’s occasionally used as a sexual reference, giving the eggplant some time off as a stand-in for a penis.

And, yup, it’s the males that display the bling in their iridescent tail, with shimmering jewel tones of blues, greens, and golds. In India and other southeast Asian cultures, the bird is symbolic of power, royalty, vanity, and pride. The ancient Greeks used the peacock as a symbol for immortality, and eventually the Christians adopted it, with the eyes in the tail representing the all-seeing eye of God. The bird eventually came to be associated with Paradise and the Tree of Life, and, essentially, immortality once again. The golden peacock symbolizes joy and creativity for Ashkenazi Jews. Talk about a hard working bird! The peacock emoji shared the limelight with a crazy mix of new emoji when it was approved as part of Unicode 11.0 in 2018.

It’s used in relation to fruit and food, to travel and hospitality, and, in certain circles, to one’s relationship status. 🤷‍♂️","And you thought a pineapple was just a pineapple! Well, sometimes it is. But, did you know that the pineapple is a symbol of hospitality, prosperity, friendship, and diplomacy too? The strange looking fruit was once popular as an architectural feature on buildings and in sculptures and its connection to travel, hospitality, and luxury is probably related to Christopher Columbus. The Italian explorer brought pineapples back from the New World, and in the 15th century, nothing said, “I have traveled far and wide” more than a pineapple … Today, the pineapple—like the lemon—is enjoyed in print design on clothing, textiles, and home decor items. It still exudes a kind of regal … deliciousness. In recent years, the pineapple emoji has been adopted on Snapchat to mean a “complicated” relationship status. Uh oh … spiky on the outside, sweet on the inside, we guess? The pineapple emoji was approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015. Emojipedia","The pineapple emoji is used by people posting about food and about pineapples specifically, about pineapple decor, and sometimes about travel. The emoji was popular on Snapchat for a while with teen girls to mean a “complicated” relationship status. (Blueberries meant “single,” and cherries indicated “in a relationship” in case you wanted to know.) That may be why the emoji is sometimes seen in sexy or flirtatious posts where a piece of fruit (other than the peach) seems out of place!   🚥 #赤 #黄  #緑  #🍎 #🍍 #🥝 #色 #果物 #フルーツ  #信号 #🚥 #感覚 #レセプター #遊び #hotel #dinner #dezert A post shared by  Hiroki Gonmori (@hiro_g1129) on Nov 9, 2018 at 7:15am PST    #🍍 A post shared by  uyu (@yogigaparadise) on Nov 9, 2018 at 6:43am PST    #мояосень  #уфа#моякрасота#💅🏻#🍍#🙈#🙉#моймастерлучший#😊 . #добрыемысли  #бытьдобру A post shared by  Ксения (@valitova848) on Nov 9, 2018 at 4:09am PST  I.$HALL.PRO$PER pic.twitter.com/tyooCppSzK — DPG Kyeu 🍍🍍 (@kyeu_) November 9, 2018  A quick one ✨ pic.twitter.com/g9B8fs9jAO — Kenna🍍 (@Mckenna_Ayers) November 6, 2018    #apineappleaday #pineapples #pineapple🍍 #pineappleshirt #pineapplestyle #pineapplelove #pineappleseveryday #🍍 A post shared by  Naomi Mayor 🍍🏠 (@pineapple.properties) on Nov 8, 2018 at 7:51pm PST  The emoji is also used in posts relating to a member of the Korean girl band Red Velvet, Seulgi, who has an affiliation with the fruit.

162,lobster-emoji,🦞, Lobster emoji,"Pass the butter! The lobster emoji, mmmmm (oops, sorry for the drooling), is finally crawling around the internet, replacing the crab emoji that was used in a pinch before 2018. Yes, of course the world needed a lobster emoji! Crab is not lobster, lobster is not crab. They’re not even related. The lobster emoji depicts the tasty marine crustacean in bright red, with its two large claws, ten legs, and delicious tail. It’s used mostly in posts related to lobster and seafood, though it has recently taken on another meaning in the transgender community.","The lobster emoji had to claw its way into a Unicode suite. After much outrage about the necessity of using the crab emoji in its place and a lobbying effort that included a pitch by Maine US Senator Angus King, the lobster finally made its debut in early 2018. It was met with howls of protest: it only had eight appendages, or legs, instead of ten. Shame. “Does it really matter? Does the poop emoji really look like poop?” naysayers wrote. Well, we are happy to report that that the Unicode Consortium corrected the mistake, and the lobster emoji, released as part of Unicode 11.0 in 2018 and added to Emoji 11.0 in 2018, is now a more accurate representation of the bug (that’s a lobster nickname, if you didn’t know) on all platforms. Twitter’s version has a whiff of whimsy about it, but there is no doubting it’s a lobster. Interestingly, the emoji has also been adopted by the transgender community, which has been lobbying Unicode for an emoji in the way of a blue and pink transgender flag for over two years. They were very disappointed when Unicode 11.0 was released and they saw that their efforts were unrewarded. Double shame. Why the lobster, you ask? The lobster is a gynandromorph, an organism that contains both male and female characteristics. Emojipedia","The lobster emoji is mostly used in food posts and in messaging that relates to the lobster in the way of branding, labels and design, and the lobstering industry. Transgender activists have also now claimed the lobster as their own—at least until the requested transgender flag is released.

Oh, you fancy Facebook …","The idea of a key being an answer, or a way to unlock something that leads to an answer, has long been part of our language. “The key to happiness.” “The key to success.” “The key to the heart.” We’ve all heard these before … A key does literally unlock something: a door, a treasure chest, a diary. There are even digital keys, composed of numbers rather than metal, used in the digital world for security measures. So, using the word key in a metaphorical way relating to an answer or solution makes a lot of sense. (Yes, we’re teaching you about metaphors right now … chill out.)

It can also imply sexuality in a larger sense, and fertility. OK then … go dream about some watermelons. In the medical world, watermelon is thought to contain an amino acid that could help stimulate blood flow, which makes it a possible boost for men with erectile dysfunction. We can think of worse ways to get in the mood than biting into a juicy piece of watermelon! Watermelon, and melon in general, is used in a vulgar way when referencing a woman’s breasts. And not just by fourteen-year-old boys … right? This is all proves why the watermelon emoji enjoys a double life: it works part-time representing summer’s favorite fruit and part-time in texting and social media to refer to sexual activity or a crude appreciation for a woman’s curves.

(Surprise, surprise.)","Since the dawn of emoji time, phallic objects and vegetables have been reliable stand-ins for male penises. (Don’t blame us, we’re only the messenger.) The virtues of the cucumber as they relate to food go back 3,000 years, when India, soon followed by Greece and Italy, began growing the cucumiform (shaped like a cucumber) fruit. Yes, it’s a fruit, not a vegetable, and it belongs to the gourd family, growing on vines like their cousins, squash and melons. The emperor Tiberius (14 AD to 37 AD) reportedly loved the fruit so much that he had the plant grown year round and demanded it on his table twice daily. They were probably smaller then, more like a gherkin, which is what the cucumber emoji is modeled after today.

In some versions it’s in peppermint swirls, in others the swirls are multi-colored or simply in shades of pink. It’s used in posts about food and sweets, or to convey the idea of sweetness or innocence, or sometimes in sexual messaging.","The classic lollipop is often a simple and straightforward way to imply sweetness, whether on the taste buds or in mood or tone. For people involved in making candy or baking desserts, the lollipop emoji fits the bill because it’s instantly recognizable, it’s colorful and eye catching, and it conveys childhood and nostalgia, memories and “sweetness” of all kinds. Another word for a lollipop is a sucker due to the way we enjoy the sugary treat. It may not be a surprise to know that the emoji is also sometimes used to convey a sexual message, perhaps evoking oral sex or other innuendos. The lollipop emoji was approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015.","The lollipop emoji is used by those with a sweet tooth, filling various social-media feeds with mouth watering pictures of desserts and candy of all kind. It’s also used to convey the idea of something that is good and positive, or exciting and excellent. It definitely leads a double life though. In a sexy, flirtatious post, it can imply an interest in oral sex. It can sometimes imply a child-like naivety combined with an overt sexuality.

Most literally, the bow and arrow emoji represents the sport of archery, so it’s often used in the metaphor “on target.” It can indicate someone is experiencing those tingles and sparkles of love. It’s also associated with the zodiac sign of Sagittarius, depicted as a mythic archer.","From ancient mammoth hunting to the legend of Robin Hood, archery has a long and rich history. This is why it was proposed to Unicode in 2015 with a number of other sports-related emoji to “fill in gaps in symbols related to popular sports—with special attention to sports featured in international competitions such as the Olympic games.” Unicode 8.0 approved the bow and arrow emoji just in advance of the 2016 Rio de Janeiro summer Olympics. The emoji—fairly uniform across platforms apart from some minor color differences—depicts an arrow strung in a bow and ready to fire. While the original intent of the bow and arrow emoji was to celebrate the sport of archery, it became a symbol of the mythic Cupid and therefore love. In Roman myths, the goddess of love, Venus, deployed her mischievous son Cupid, to strike powerless humans with his arrows and fall in love. These associations have continued into modern times—from popular music to, well, emoji.","Alongside the heart with arrow emoji, 💘, the bow and arrow emoji is commonly used to express love, affection, and attraction, whether it’s their bae or a celebrity crush.

177,japanese-dolls,🎎, Japanese Dolls emoji,"Some emoji can seem utterly obscure or random, but they often have important meanings in Japan, where emoji originated. Like the Japanese dolls emoji, 🎎, which shows a male and female doll in traditional Japanese dress. They are meant to represent the Emperor and Empress of Japan and used for the March 3rd celebration of Hinamatsuri, or Doll’s Day or Girl’s Day.","The Japanese dolls emoji depicts a seated male and a female figure in traditional Japanese costume dating from the Heian Period (794–1185). These dolls are a major feature of the Peach Festival (Momo no Sekku), which became the Japanese Dolls Festival or Girl’s Day (Hinamatsuri) and celebrated on March 3. The male doll is known as obina and the female doll as mebina, and together they are meant to depict a royal wedding ceremony between an emperor and empress or prince and princess. The tradition of displaying these dolls during the Peach Festival dates back to at least 1625, when imperial court ladies set up a place for the emperor’s daughter, Oki-ko, to play. It’s believed that initially the dolls were for playing with, but now they are mainly for display. Many girls in Japan receive a set of these often expensive dolls, some of which are passed down as heirlooms. These Japanese dolls were approved under Unicode 6.0 in 2010. As shown in the screenshot from Emojipedia below, the Apple emoji for Japanese dolls is the most detailed. The male doll, seated on the left, is dressed in blue and the female doll emoji is dressed in red. Both dolls have traditional Imperial Japanese headdresses as well.

The Vulcan salute emoji, 🖖, is perfect for showing your Star Trek cred or sci-fi pride more generally.","The Vulcan Salute emoji is officially called the raised hand with part between middle and ring fingers emoji. And, that’s exactly what the emoji shows across platforms. Its default hue is yellow, but skin-tone modifiers allow users to change color. It joined emoji keyboards under Unicode 7.0 in 2014. The emoji commonly goes by the Vulcan salute because the gesture was popularized by Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy), who used it as a greeting in the sci-fi franchise, Star Trek. Nimoy first used the gesture in the 1967 TV episode “Amok Time,” in which Spock comes into contact with other members of his Vulcan race. Nimoy wanted the Vulcans to have a way of greeting one another similar to human hand gestures. In an interview with New York Times, Nimoy said that his Vulcan salute was inspired by a gesture that he witnessed during a Jewish religious service when he was a boy. Jewish priests perform the actual religious gesture with both hands to form the Hebrew letter shin, ש. The greeting Live long and prosper! has also accompanied the Vulcan salute ever since its debut in “Amok Time,” also inspired by Jewish scripture, with Deuteronomy 5:33 being the most cited inspiration for the phrase.  The Vulcan salute went memetic almost immediately after Nimoy’s first usage of the gesture. According to Nimoy, mere weeks after “Amok Time” aired, people were already using the gesture to greet him everywhere he went. The gesture was first popular among Star Trek fans but the gesture’s similarity to the popular V-shaped peace hand gesture (✌️), both in finger placement and good-willed intent, helped it catch on outside that community. The Vulcan salute was popular long before the rise of social media, so it comes as no surprise that the emoji version took off right away after Unicode added it on June 16, 2014. 🖖 — Kim Ahlström (@Kimtaro) June 16, 2014  Prior to that day, users had to make due with typographical substitutes. @pruet \V/_ Vulcan salute — Keng ☂ (@kengggg) November 14, 2007 ","The Vulcan salute emoji is used anytime someone wants to flash the greeting and good wishes.

It signifies so many things, but it is mostly used in posts relating to food and the fall season. In addition to being a symbol for that delightful change of season (apple picking time!), it also represents education and teachers, and is a nod to Manhattan, or New York City, which has the nickname “Big Apple.” That nickname was coined by a sports writer in the 1920s and then picked up and revived by marketing agencies in the 1970s for a promotional campaign … guess it worked. The origins of the apple as a signifier for things related to school go back to the 1700s, when families in countries like Denmark would pay their teachers with baskets of apples. American families continued the tradition, with an occasional apple-for-the-teacher token until the early- to mid-1900s. It’s especially fitting since the apple long represented wisdom, going back to Greek mythology.

186,love-hotel,🏩, Love Hotel emoji,"Oh, boy. This emoji has two distinctly different ideas behind it. The love hotel or heart hospital emoji depicts a building with both a pink heart and on some platforms the letter H emblazoned on the front. It is mostly used in reference to hospitals and health as well as to vacation resorts. Those uses are far from the reported original intent, which was to indicate a house of ill repute (i.e., a bad reputation).","When the love hotel or heart hospital emoji  was created and approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 , it apparently meant a hotel where rooms may be rented by the hour, for … love. By the time it was added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015, the use had shifted. Maybe it’s the letter H atop the building or the sweet pink heart over the entrance. It might be the fact that it actually looks a bit like the hospital emoji seen here 🏥, depending on your viewing platform. Whatever it is, this is one of the most misused emojis we’ve come across; instead of being used to refer to a “love hotel,” it often just references hospitals and health care. It’s also used to mean a romantic resort or vacation getaway. So … a hotel for prostitution? Not so much. That’s why the love hotel emoji now has a second name: the heart hospital emoji. Emojipedia","It’s fun seeing the love hotel emoji used to mean things other than what it was intended for. Or, maybe we just have a twisted sense of humor. At any rate, here, the intent is clearly a medical reference: Quick #CarFreeDayIndy recap with Gene Berry of @OneAmerica – we took the Monon from 54th.

187,love-letter,💌, Love Letter emoji,"The love letter emoji is one of many that use a traditional heart to convey the idea of love. On all platforms, the emoji is depicted with a simple envelope line drawing, the flap sealed with a pink or red heart sticker. It’s used in all kinds of posts and messages about love and affection.","Is there anything more romantic than a declaration of love in written form? Sadly, love letters have fallen out of favor …. Critics of texting and social media claim that even the act of writing a friendly letter has become a thing of the past, and that people are not learning to express themselves the way they used to. Yes, you could write a love letter to someone by email, but chances are good it won’t have the same impact as a handwritten one, lovingly folded and put into an envelope, addressed by the besotted‘s writer’s hand. Finding a real love letter in one’s mailbox is a thing to be savored and remembered. Or … so we’ve heard. Nobody’s writing the dictionary these days. Who wrote the first love letter, you ask? Chances are good the first declaration of love took its form in a gift of a dead animal or perhaps a cave drawing. That’s more romantic than email, too, we guess. The love letter emoji though wasn’t first written until it was approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015. Emojipedia","The love letter emoji is used to express general affection, friendly love, familial love, romantic love, “positive vibes,” and even hard crushes on pop idols, a very popular usage on Twitter in general.

188,graduation-cap,🎓, Graduation Cap emoji,"The graduation cap emoji is an image of a square, black board affixed to a skull cap with a tassel attached at the center, hanging to one side. It’s typically worn by those graduating from high school or college. The emoji, however, is used in social-media posts about graduation, teaching and school, and also about learning in general.","The classic graduation cap is also known as a “mortar board,” because of its resemblance to the usually flat pan a bricklayer uses for mortar … weird. The cap is usually worn with an academic gown, resulting in the phrase, “cap and gown.” The style of the graduation cap is thought to go back to the biretta, a cap worn by Roman Catholic clergy, which evolved to be worn by noblemen and military leaders in the medieval and Renaissance and ages. It was originally only worn by holders of master’s degrees, but eventually undergraduates and those earning bachelors’ degrees were allowed to wear it too. Now, you can find pint-sized graduate caps for young children. The graduation cap  emoji got it’s degree when it was approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015. Emojipedia","Whether graduating college or completing an employer-mandated course, people love to use the graduation cap emoji. It’s also used in social-media posts that relate to education and self awareness in a variety of ways.

189,lemon,🍋, Lemon emoji,"This pretty yellow citrus fruit is represented here in its simplest form, a tilted, yellow oval with a green leaf or two attached to the stem. It has several meanings, referring both to the fruit and its byproducts, like lemonade, in a literal sense, and to other representations which range from difficulties in life to love for a certain pop star. 🐝🍋","Lemons are associated with many things, including food, health, beverages, the much beloved performer Beyoncé, fabric and decorative design, and of course, the occasional bump in the road (a lemon) with which the resourceful person might make lemonade. Since lemons are sour, the metaphor works to suggest that life is not all sweetness and ease, and when one has a difficult moment, one should make the best of it. Often attributed to self-improvement guru Dale Carnegie in the 1940s, the first to use lemons as a “bad thing,” according to Wikipedia, was one Christian anarchist writer named Elbert Hubbard, in a 1915 eulogy for a friend: “He picked up the lemons that Fate had sent him and started a lemonade-stand.” Then, 100 years later the lemon emoji was approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015. And so the story goes. Emojipedia","Pucker up! Ok, lemons might cause some weird facial expressions, but in the right context, they are a delicious food item, an essential ingredient in some adult beverages, and they also make for a quite delicious decorating motif, among other things.

Snapchat included it in their 2015 update as a Friends Emojis, a system to help you manage your contacts by adding emoji next to each person to indicate how you feel about them. Across platforms this emoji’s round yellow face has an impishly curved smile and looks slyly to the left. On the Google and Microsoft versions the curves are softer, giving it a shyer appearance.

It’s used to express a variety of emotions, ranging from frustration to pumped-up passion about a particular topic.","The face with steam from nose emoji was first approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 under the name Face With Look of Triumph and was intended to reflect a feeling of victory or pride. Hmmm. That was later downgraded to “disdainful,” but clearly this emoji depicts emotions like anger, frustration, determination, and pride, more than disdain. Though, instead of steam coming out of the little guy’s head, which is generally how we express this kind of discontent (in the world of cartoons and illustrations anyway), it’s raging out of his nostrils, which is sort of weird.

193,moai,🗿, Moai emoji,"The moai emoji depicts a head with elongated ears, nose, and a heavy brow, appearing to be carved out of gray stone. Use of the moai emoji is usually meant to imply strength or determination, and it’s also used frequently in Japanese pop-culture posts.","What the $&** is a moai? Well … moai is a type of rock carving found on Easter Island in Polynesia, dating back to the year 1250. They are monolithic creations, with the faces of deified ancestors; the oversized heads are the largest feature of the figures. The origin of this emoji is a bit clouded, as some claim it was suggested by Japan in reference to a statue referred to as Moyai at the Shibuya Station in Tokyo, Japan, something of a landmark. Moyai looks a bit like the Easter Island moai statuary, with the long broad nose and pronounced brow. But, the similarity ends there. The Moyai statue, a gift in the 1980s to the district from Japan’s volcanic Nii-jima Island, has very full lips (moai are thin) and the carving implies a mane of hair, which is not a feature of the maoi carvings. Nii-jima is home to numerous volcanic rock carvings of large faces and heads, called Moyai, which means ‘to work together in effort’ in the local dialect. They are like the younger cousins of Polynesia’s ancient carvings. The emoji, in our opinion, more closely resembles the Eastern Island relics. But some feel Japan sought the Moyai emoji as an accompaniment to other emoji, such as the Japanese flag and the Tokyo Tower. Others think the Polynesian relics are so distinctive and historic, that they deserved the emoji treatment. That said, the emoji was approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 under the name “Moyai,” not “moai,” and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015.  It’s unclear when the spelling changed to “moai.” Most platforms’ version of this emoji present a reasonable representation of actual moai, also spelled mo‘ai because we had to add another name just to confuse you … although most of the ancient carvings of the actual statues include bodies as well. Emojipedia","The moai emoji is seen frequently in social-media posts that revolve around Japanese and Korean pop music  (like BTS, also known as Bangtan Boys), and in posts related to Japanese and Polynesian culture in general. However, it can also be used to imply strength, silence, and mystery.

Emojipedia With its diverse colors coming together into one, the rainbow has been a symbol of LGBTQ pride since 1978. That year, San Francisco politician and iconic gay rights activist Harvey Milk commissioned Gilbert Baker, a drag queen and US military veteran, to create a new flag to represent the LGBTQ community.

199,three-wise-monkeys,🙈,", ,  Three Wise Monkey emoji","The see–no-evil monkey emoji depicts the face of a monkey covered with the monkey’s hands. Most versions show the monkey’s mouth in a slight smile, which almost hints at a “hide or seek”  game, and it’s used in a wide variety of contexts such as, “Did I really say that?” to “I won’t tell a soul.” Similarly, the hear-no-evil monkey is used when people hear things they shouldn’t have or didn’t want to hear. And, we bet you can guess what the say-no-evil monkey emoji is used for … yup, when you just blurted out the wrong thing in the wrong situation. Nice job. But “see no evil” is part of the proverb, “see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil,” and is meant to carry a more significant message.","The ancient Japanese proverb “see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil” was popularized in the 17th century as a pictorial Shinto maxim, carved in the famous Tōshō-gū Shinto shrine in Nikkō, Japan. Three Wise Monkeys illustrated the idea of protecting one’s self from unsavory or challenging behavior, thought, or language. The saying embraces a Buddhist tenet of not dwelling on evil thoughts, though in Western cultures, the adage is colored with the idea of pretending to be ignorant or choosing to look the other way, and it implies some question of character. Monkeys are important in the Shinto religion, and the adage was represented with three monkeys in the carving: Wise monkey Mizaru, covers his eyes, and sees no evil; Kikazaru covers his ears, and hears no evil; and Iwazaru covers his mouth, and speaks no evil. Early Chinese Confucian philosophy certainly played a role in the birth of the adage, as a Confucian phrase from the third or fourth century B.C. reads, “Look not at what is contrary to propriety; listen not to what is contrary to propriety; speak not what is contrary to propriety; make no movement which is contrary to propriety.” Early Buddhist and Hindu versions of the idea varied, and in some illustrations there was a fourth monkey that referred to that last principle in the Confucian expression. The monkey, Shizaru, symbolized “do no evil,” and was shown either crossing his arms or covering his genitals. The Hindu interpretation of the fourth monkey was more along the lines of “don’t flaunt your happiness” than “don’t do evil things.” The see-no-evil Mizaru emoji— like its cohorts, Kikazaru and Iwazaru—was approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015. And, like its cohorts, the emoji is often used in lighthearted ways, and certainly not with the serious thought its creators intended. But, hey, that’s what happens when a couple of thousands of years pass. If the core concepts of the maxim remain, well, that’s pretty impressive, right?","People use the see-no-evil monkey emoji and its counterparts in a variety of ways, and as noted above, they’re seldom used with the original meaning with which the saying was created for. All three wise monkey emoji enjoy popularity because monkeys are cute, and the covering of one’s ears or mouth has a way of conveying a feeling with few words: embarrassment, surprise, self-deprecation, questioning, and “la la la, I can’t hear you!” to name a few. For example, although the three wise monkeys in unified pose don’t seem quite adequate for the inspirational thought expressed here, we think we get the real idea at play here. Poor little chimp, the butt of the joke: the three monkeys together convey a sense of “Do you even see this? I can’t believe what I’m seeing/hearing, and I’m covering my mouth so I don’t laugh too loud!” Tenacity is the key to #success! 🙊🙈🙉😹  pic.twitter.com/41zBycTjxa #TuesdayMotivation via @JenaC2 @MakMakay — Linda Freeman (@lindafreeman_) September 4, 2018  When used for sheer cuteness, the wisdom of the ages goes right out the window: two seconds of cuteness for you🙊🙈 pic.twitter.com/wz2EaIEjj5 — a l i 🦕 (@aliciaaaalopez) September 6, 2018  Sometimes the monkeys are clearly used incorrectly, as in this post where the idea might have been hands slapping the side the of the face in surprise and joy—but that’s not what Kikazaru is all about!

201,sauropod,🦕, Sauropod emoji,"The sauropod emoji depicts the general features of a Sauropoda, the largest known land animal which lived during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods … but in a slightly cartoonish way. Shown with a small head, short thick legs, long neck, and tail, the emoji exudes a kind benevolence, fitting for this herbivorous creature. The emoji can be used to express enthusiasm for dinosaurs, of course, as well as a critique of something or someone who is seen as old-fashioned or outdated.","Well, it’s about time! It may not have taken 66-million years (which is when dinosaurs vanished from the Earth), but a lot of people were long anticipating the arrival of this emoji. There were forums and web pages devoted to it, and even the Natural History Museum in London got on board with an internet-wide  “Sauropod Emoji Campaign.” People complained about too many chickens and a plethora of train emoji. “Why no dinosaurs?” they cried. The sauropod was finally approved as part of Unicode 10.0 in 2017 and added to Emoji 5.0 in 2017, which is when the T-rex emoji also appeared. Across platforms, the sauropod appears mostly blue or green and is full-bodied except for Facebook’s version, which features the head only. Sometimes you just have to wait for nice things. Emojipedia","Dinosaur fans were flat-out elated when the sauropod emoji appeared. However, the word dinosaur can sometimes imply a negative, and the emoji can be used to relate to a person or thing (a business or tradition, for example) that is out of step with the current times or about to become obsolete. It can also be used to refer to something outrageously large. #dinosaur Emoji's are reeeaaal!!!!! I might be a bit too excited about this!?

The duck emoji started out on the water, with a few hairs on his head blowing in the wind, but by the time it was approved as part of Unicode 9.0 and added to Emoji 3.0 in 2016, it had been simplified: the little duck body appeared on little duck legs, instead of bobbing in blue water. He’s a more dignified creature now, and there is certainly no rubber duck nonsense here. That, however, doesn’t stop people from using it when they’re referring to their significant other with a pet name like “ducky.” Emojipedia","The duck emoji finds itself in some strange places.

204,cigarette-emoji,🚬, Cigarette emoji,"The cigarette emoji, 🚬, shows a lit cigarette. It’s used for smoking cigarettes, cigars, and especially marijuana joints. It’s occasionally associated with relaxing, partying, bad boys, sexiness, and having an attitude.","Most of us are familiar with the no smoking sign and its emoji form, 🚭. It’s what the pilot turns on before a flight takes off if you haven’t air-travelled since 1988 and have forgotten you’re not allowed to smoke on a plane—and pretty much anywhere else. But where you can smoke, you might see the smoking symbol, as the cigarette emoji is officially called by Unicode. It was approved in 2010 under Unicode 6.0. Platforms depict it as a filtered cigarette with smoke lines and a red or ashy burning tip, as shown by the screenshot from Emojipedia below.

205,red-paper-lantern-emoji,🏮, Izakaya Lantern emoji,"The izakaya lantern emoji, 🏮, is designed to look like a red paper lantern that’s typically hung outside an izakaya, a Japanese bar that usually also serves small, mostly fried or grilled dishes. Like a pub, but Japanese. The emoji is used to represent not only such pubs, but Japanese and East Asian culture more generally. ","The Japanese characters izakaya, 居酒屋, mean “to be/exist” (i/居), “alcohol” (zaka/酒), and “shop/seller” (ya/屋). A literal translation of the word could be something like “a shop that has alcohol” or “alcohol stand” (as in “fruit stand”). FYI, zaka/酒 can also be pronounced sake, and is the character for the specific drink, too.  In Japan, izakayas traditionally hang a red paper lantern out in front to mark themselves as bars for interested parties. (Think a Guinness sign outside an Irish pub.) They usually have words painted on them like 居酒屋 (izakaya), 酒 (sake/alcohol), or, you know, the name of the bar. フォト蔵 These lanterns are known as akachochin (赤提灯), which literally translates as “red paper lantern.” Izakayas are so closely connected with the red paper lanterns, in fact, that one slang term for these bars is actually akachochin. These lanterns, and their bars, are what the softly lit 🏮 emoji is designed to resemble.  食べログ The Unicode Consortium released the izakaya lantern emoji in August 2010 as part of Unicode 6.0, which was the first version of the Unicode standard to support emoji. It’s officially called izakaya lantern emoji but commonly referred to as red paper lantern emoji.","You’ll often see the izakaya lantern emoji in the captions of pictures taken at real izakayas.  #先付け #八寸 この後に、#刺し身 #焼き魚 #煮物 #麦切り これで3500円だからコスパ良すぎ👌 アルコールは1500円2時間飲み放題👍 生ビール・地元山形純米酒・鹿児島芋焼酎・大分麦焼酎・スコッチウイスキー・サワー・ハイボール・カクテルなどなど😱 合わせて、5千円ポッキリ😃 言うことなし🙆‍♂️ #居酒屋 #川なり #yamagata #🏮 #japanesefood  #japanesebar A post shared by  ミハイルオヤジ♂ (@mikhail.oyaji) on Aug 20, 2018 at 2:24pm PDT   🍛Curry Rice with Wagyu,Chicken and Cheese 🧀  at IZAKAYA 555 BTS Prakanong (❗️This is not Menu) If you want order,Pls show this photo to 555 staff😋 #カレーライス #🍛 #curryrice #japanesecurry #curry #izakayabkk #izakaya555 #btsprakanong #居酒屋五五五 #🏮 #居酒屋のカレー #wagyu #seseri #chicken A post shared by  DeliciousBangkok (@delibang) on Aug 18, 2018 at 9:03pm PDT  Since lanterns like the one izakaya lantern emoji represents are common to see at festivals and shrines across Asia (not just in Japan), this emoji also shows up next to pictures of Asian festivals, shrines, and temples.

206,christmas-tree-emoji,🎄, Christmas Tree emoji,"‘Tis the season for the Christmas tree emoji 🎄. This emoji is an image of a traditional Christmas tree, one decorated with colorful ornaments and, in most cases, a star on top. It’s used mostly in early November as the holiday season gets underway, until just past the new year in mid- to late-January. While it might be jarring to see the Christmas tree emoji 🎄in May or August, many use it simply to reference the holiday season.","The Christmas Tree emoji 🎄 was approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 and added to the Emoji 1.0 catalog in 2015. The traditional evergreen conifer is shown with colorful ornaments, although WhatsApp has a simpler tree with ornaments in a uniform red color. On most platforms, the topper is a star, which is the most popular tree-topper, representing the Star of Bethlehem, though angels are sometimes used as well, a reference to the archangel Gabriel. Christmas trees date back to medieval Latvia and Estonia, with the tradition becoming popular in the 1500s in Germany, where live trees were brought into homes and wooden pyramids were also constructed and decorated with apples, paper, evergreen boughs, and candles. Many believe the 16th-century Protestant reformer Martin Luther to be responsible for the tradition of adding lit candles, reportedly inspired by the twinkling stars above a treeline as he walked home one night. Largely thought to be a pagan tradition in the New World, Christmas trees didn’t really catch on with Americans until the early 1800s.","The Christmas Tree emoji 🎄 is used to reference the holiday season, to celebrate, and to convey best wishes. It’s also used to promote holiday business and to express a sincere desire for winter and the coziness of the holiday season—even in summer.

207,fireworks-emoji,🎆, Fireworks emoji,"The Fireworks emoji 🎆 depicts a burst of color, displayed in the way that traditional fireworks fan out from a central point when they explode. It’s used in social media and texting to convey a celebratory mood or message and is most heavily used on New Year’s Eve and on the Fourth of July.","The Fireworks emoji 🎆 was approved as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015. It comes in a range of colors and styles. This symbol is beloved and widely used, as it can express excitement, surprise, congratulations, and other high emotions. It’s also frequently used twice a year in the United States, on the Fourth of July, or Independence Day, and New Year’s Eve, on December 31. The first American Independence Day display occurred in Philadelphia (with a smaller display in Boston) on the country’s one year birthday, July 4, 1777. Statesman John Adams, who helped draft the Declaration of Independence, wrote in a letter to his wife, Abigail, that there should be a “great anniversary Festival,” one “solemnized with Pomp and Parade, with Shews, Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other from this Time forward forever more.” And, so it was! Did you know that fireworks go back to China’s Tang Dynasty in the ninth century? They believed fireworks could dispel bad luck and evil spirits and bring about just the opposite. So, it makes sense to begin each new year with a colorful display of things exploding in the sky, right? All done within reason (and with caution), of course!","The Fireworks emoji 🎆 enjoys doing double and triple duty, as it can be used for holiday celebrations, for expressing congratulations, for personal achievements or expressions of pride, for surprises of all kinds, and simply to express joy.

Sometimes referred to as the worried face emoji, it is also used to express concern and angst. It’s not exactly “The Scream,” so no need to panic: there is a glimmer of hope, a possible way out. The blue shading at the top is used to represent a pale face … as in so shocked you lost your color. Maybe it’s the teeth, but the HTC version of this emoji is particularly unsettling in our opinion, as this chart from Emojipedia shows.

People use it for everything from when a beloved friend passes away to when they couldn’t get tickets to the Beyoncé concert 😞.","The disappointed face was added to Unicode 6.0 in 2010. On most platforms, it appears as a yellow face frowning with closed eyes and eyebrows furrowed in sadness.

It might also be mistaken for the slightly frowning face emoji, 🙁, which doesn’t have eyebrows and seems to be saying Eep! On some platforms, when you type in :(, it will auto-supply the disappointed face emoji. That makes it one of the most commonly used emoji, essentially used as a go-to sad face, as the emoji is indeed sometimes called. The disappointed face emoji is used to add tone and subtext to messages on social media or texts that could otherwise come off as flat or harsh.

214,bento-box-emoji,🍱, Bento Box emoji,"The bento box emoji, 🍱, represents a traditional Japanese boxed lunch, called a bento box, or a meal at a Japanese restaurant in the same style.  It’s used for such lunches and meals, as well as for Japanese and Asian cuisine more generally, and Western small-plate dishes and snacks. ","In Japanese, bento (弁当, among other forms) literally just means “lunch box” or “packed lunch,” traced back to a medieval Chinese term for “convenient.” How handy.  oceans-nadia.com Bento refers to both the lunch container and the lunch itself, but the container is more commonly referred to as a bento box. Originally made of bamboo, contemporary bento boxes are made of wood, plastic, metal, and other materials. A traditional Japanese lunch consists of rice, plus small dishes of veggies and fish or meat, and bento boxes are often sectioned off in serving them—as the bento box emoji so depicts, like in this screenshot from Emojipedia below. Emojipedia Bentos started out as homemade lunches to take to work or school. Over time, they also began appearing in train stations and convenience stores as grab-and-go food options for commuters and traveling workers. Some Japanese restaurants, especially sushi restaurants in the West, also offer set bento box meals in lacquered, sectioned trays.   #osaka to #tokyo #bento on the #sinkansen #sinkansen🚄 #japantravels #Japan #summer #travel #🍱 #rice #meat #peachfrappuccino A post shared by  Grace_C (@the.grace.c) on Aug 1, 2018 at 9:32pm PDT  The bento box emoji was approved in 2010 under Unicode 6.0 and joins a number of other Japan-specific emoji known to confuse Westerners who forget that emoji originate in Japan (such as the Japanese dolls 🎎, sake bottle and cup 🍶, and goblin 👺). As you may have noticed, most versions of the bento box emoji across platforms look more like a restaurant set meal tray than a lunch box. This is likely a consequence of Western designers (and emoji users) being more familiar with the restaurant type of bento box. ","By far the most popular use of the bento box emoji is to caption or reference pictures of actual bento boxes. Thanks to some serious social pressure on Japanese parents to send their children to school with lunches that were both nutritionally balanced and aesthetically nice, bento boxes have a worldwide reputation as some of the cutest, most photogenic lunches around.  Search interest in the term bento box spikes each year around August or September, which in many Western countries is at the start of the new school year (school starts in March or April in Japan). Part of this could be parents, including many of Japanese heritage, looking at recipes and ideas for lunches to pack for school and work. If you ever need some lunch inspo (and don’t mind a little lunch envy) give #🍱 or #弁当 a look.   おはようございます。 旦那サンの分は写メ間に合わず。 まぁ内容一緒ですが🍱 暑くて買い物すら行くのが面倒くさく野菜室は大葉、ピーマンのみになりました。 ・ ※炒飯 ※焼売 ※ひじき ※赤ウインナー ※竹輪の大葉巻き ※辛子メンマ ※胡瓜のピクルス ・ 今日は流石に買い物行きますが、息子に必要な2Lのアクエリアスが品薄でなかなか売っていない見かけない( ；∀；) 運が良ければ巡り会えるか⁉️ ・ #今日のお弁当#お弁当#お弁当記録#お弁当作り楽しもう部#お昼が楽しみになるお弁当#旦那弁当#息子弁当#自分弁当#置き弁#おべんたー#lunchbox#lunch#お昼ごはん#料理#家庭料理#料理写真#つくりおき#豊かな食卓#クッキングラム#オベンタグラム#おうちごはんlove#炒飯#日々の暮らし#残り物#セリア #lin_stagrammer#delistagrammer#bento#japanesefood#🍱 A post shared by  kayo (@kayochi04) on Aug 1, 2018 at 2:57pm PDT    2018/08/02 おはようございます🌞 今日は #中華そぼろ弁当 . . ミンチ肉が続いてる…😂 今日の夜は塊肉食べような！！ ✨🍽🍷🍴🍾✨ . 昨日早く仕事が終われたので 本屋さんに行って #栗原はるみ の本を買ったら やる気が出てしまい🦖🦖 (買っただけでまだ読んでない) かぼちゃさらだ🎃 豚バラチャーシュー🐷 自家製アイス2種類🍦 などなど作りまくった！！！💪 . . 今日も早く帰ってアイス食べよ～🍨❤️ . #お弁当 #弁当 #わっぱ #わっぱ弁当 #今日のお弁当 #ランチ #lunch #お弁当作り楽しもう部 #マカロニメイト #クッキングラム #cooking #おうちごはん #じゅりキッチン #ペケ弁  #のっけ弁 #地味弁 #colorful  #エルグルメ  #おしゃ弁 #🍱 #bento #おひるごはん #共働き #飯炊きババア A post shared by  じゅりぴー🍺 (@juriiipee) on Aug 1, 2018 at 6:23pm PDT    今日はくまさん弁当🐻🍱🍴 . 今日も元気にいってらっしゃい❣️ . #3歳 #3歳5ヶ月 #保育園 #保育園弁当 #毎日弁当 #お弁当記録 #娘弁当 #幼稚園弁当 #年少さん弁当 #お弁当 #キャラ弁 #キャラクター弁当 #🍱 #キャラ弁初心者 #デコ弁 #愛情弁当 #iro弁当 #こども弁当 #こども #幼児弁当 #幼稚園弁当 #ミニ弁当 #くまさん弁当 #くまさん #🐻 #しろくま A post shared by  YKR·͜·♡ (@irobentou) on Aug 1, 2018 at 5:35pm PDT  You’ll also see the bento box emoji alongside photos of non-bento or nontraditional bento box lunches.   在芝加哥最喜歡去的日本料理店 One of my favorite Japanese restaurant in Chicago #chicago #umai #japanese #japaneserestaurant #salmon #udon #鮭魚丼 #牛丼 #烏龍麵 #🍱 #🍣 A post shared by  💋Vicky 琦 👑 (@vickyinchicago) on Aug 1, 2018 at 8:57pm PDT    @chama_rh is loaded up for her day!

On Apple devices, this emoji sits beside the fireworks emoji 🎆 and the sparkler emoji 🎇 in the Travel & Places section.

230,bactrian-camel-emoji,🐫, Bactrian Camel emoji,"The Bactrian camel emoji, 🐫, depicts the two-humped camel native to Central Asia—not to be confused with its one-humped cousin, the Dromedary camel and its emoji, 🐪. Yup, there are two camel emojis. Both camel emoji, however, often get used interchangeably for actual camels, camel mascots, deserts, exotic or historic treks in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, and puns on all things “hump.” ","The Bactrian camel emoji shows the two-humped camel that is native to Central and East Asia’s deserts. Fun fact: Whether one hump or two, camels use their humps to store fat, which they break down into water and energy, helping them travel long distances in extreme temperatures without food or drink. That made it pretty handy for Silk Road caravans.  So, why is there an emoji of this funny-looking mammal? Well, because there’s an emoji for just about every animal, it seems, especially large mammals like camels. That, and camel diversity, apparently. No camel racism, please. Both the Dromedary and Bactrian camel emoji were approved in 2010. Across platforms, the light-brown Bactrian camel appears in profile on all platforms so you can clearly see its two humps. Some platforms, Apple and WhatsApp, further set apart their Bactrian camel emoji from its Dromedary counterpart by depicting shaggier hair. That detail is true to life, as Bactrian camels are indigenous to colder climates. Emojipedia","People use the Bactrian camel emoji and the Dromedary camel emoji interchangeably, though its seems the Dromedary camel emoji is slightly more popular on social media—probably because Bactrian camels themselves are fairly rare and therefore less familiar.

248,goblin-emoji,👺, Goblin emoji,"The Goblin emoji 👺 depicts a tengu, or an arrogant character from Japanese folklore. It is portrayed as a red mask with menacing eyes and a frown. It has bushy black eyebrows and a mustache—and of course, the tengu’s signature long nose. People in the West commonly use it to suggest trolling, evil, anger, mischief, and naughtiness—including the sexy kind.","The tengu assumed emoji form as the Goblin emoji 👺 in 2010 under Unicode 6.0 and is officially called Japanese Goblin.  Westerners unfamiliar with the tengu, however, often call the emoji a goblin or troll.  Recorded in literature as early as 720 CE, tengu have deep roots in Japanese folklore, where they’re a type of minor Shinto god and yokai (a general monster, goblin, or demon).   Wikimedia Commons Tengu are a type of anthropomorphic bird-dog creature, literally meaning “sky-dog” in the Japanese kanji 天狗. The tengu is a boastful trickster distinguished by its long nose, prominently featured on masks for tengu characters in Japanese kabuki and Noh theater.   Wikipedia In January 2018, Unicode recommended against a distinct troll emoji due to similarities in form and use to the goblin and Ogre emoji 👹, which is based on another creature from Japanese folklore. ","Among Japanese users, the Goblin emoji 👺 can call someone out as conceited or arrogant, in line with the tengu’s role in their culture. Those unfamiliar with the tengu, however, often use the emoji to call out internet trolling.

It also generally means “absolutely” or “keep it 100” (keep it real). ","Officially called Hundred Points, this emoji commonly goes by 100, Keep it 100, or Perfect Score. It was introduced in Unicode 6.0 in 2010. 100 emoji originates from teachers’ use of 100, often written or stamped in red ink, to indicate a perfect score on an assignment. Keep it 100 is a slang phrase, apparently, from use of one-hundred percent meaning “absolutely,” “perfect,” and by extension “authentic,” or “real.” The 100 emoji is sometimes used in place of or alongside the phrase keep it 100, or “keep it real.” On Snapchat, 100 emoji appears next to a friend’s name to represent a 100-day Snapstreak, i.e., you message that person too much.","The 100 emoji is commonly used on social media for an excellent performance, especially by professional athletes (e.g., “My respect for Lebron James transcends sports.

Every meaning associated with the smiling face with heart-shaped eyes emoji is positive. It usually serves as an overwhelmingly happy response to a subject. This could be a person, a place, a thing, or even just a concept. No matter the object that warrants this emoji’s use, it pretty much functions as a shorthand for “I love this.” The hearts in its eyes say it all.","When this emoji is directed at people, it’s often because the person using this emoji greatly admires them. It could appear on retweets of a particularly poignant celebrity quote. Non-romantic love in general favors this emoji. It’s a fantastic way to cheer people on and let them know they’re cared for. One way to do this is to use it in response to a particularly beautiful picture. It could be part of a comment on a really well-framed selfie on social media. It could also be about how much the commenter loves an outfit, makeup, outfit, hairstyle etc., be it their own or someone else’s. It may also be used when romantic love is involved and someone wants to express how much they adore their partner, since hearts often carry such a meaning. The smiling face with heart-shaped eyes emoji is also great for reactions to animals, landscapes, and foods, just to name a few more categories. For example, if someone saw a really cute dog, they might use this emoji along with an exclamation about how adorable the dog is. They could also use it in an instance where they love something so much that they want it for themselves. People also favor it when reacting to pictures of a baked good or meal, or scenery from a beautiful place, which they might want to experience firsthand because it’s so delicious-looking or breathtaking. This emoji is often used in responses to exciting concepts, too. Maybe someone’s favorite musician has just announced that they are coming to a fan’s city. It could also be used as a response to an inspiring quote posted on social media, or kinds words from a friend or follower.",https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/svg/1f60d.svg,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/smiling-face-with-heart-shaped-eyes-emoji/

The gesture dates as far back as 423 BC when Ancient-Greek comic-playwright Aristophanes used the gesture in his play, The Clouds. It is considered a phallic symbol, originally meant to threaten violent sexual penetration, which has developed into its contemporary meaning of “fuck you” or “go fuck yourself.” It is now often used to express displeasure, rage, excitement, or protest. Approved by Unicode in 2014 (U+1F595), the middle finger emoji became widely popular at the end of 2015. This is when Apple released the iOS 9.1 update, which included the middle finger among several new emoji. The emoji’s official name is Reversed Hand With Middle Finger Extended, and it also goes by the names rude finger, flipping the bird, and dito medio.","Raising the middle finger has become a common, vulgar gesture signifying anger or rebellion, though it may be most recognizable in Western culture. It can be used in a range of contexts: by celebrities when photographed by paparazzi, by drivers expressing road rage, or among friends in a playful manner. The emoji is used similarly. As with the actual gesture, the emoji may be considered extremely rude and inappropriate, especially in formal contexts.",https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/svg/1f595.svg,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/middle-finger-emoji/

Outside of these, this emoji can be used for even still more ambiguous emotions.","Since its inclusion in Unicode 8.0 in 2015, the upside-down face emoji has filled a gap in emoji users’ symbolic inventory. It can help to convey tones like sarcasm or silliness in written text, as well as to communicate confusion or irony.

Important context: While the OK hand emoji 👌 has many harmless meanings, it was co-opted as a white supremacist symbol in the late 2010s. One should now be mindful of context when using or coming across this emoji.","The OK hand emoji is also referred to as the A-OK, OK, or OK hand sign emoji. Like the word OK, the OK hand emoji can convey simple agreement, understanding, or satisfaction. If someone texts a friend asking if they want to meet up, the friend might reply with the OK hand emoji as if to say “OK,” “Sure,” or “Sounds good.” In these contexts, the OK hand emoji can stand in for the word OK or related terms.

Forget to hit save. .” As with other emoji, strings of OK hands can intensify or emphasize the sentiment. Beginning in 2017, the “OK” hand gesture began to be interpreted as a white supremacist hand signal due to a hoax spread by alt-right communities and users of the web site 4chan that the symbol was actually a secret white supremacist gesture. At first used to troll the media, the gesture eventually lost its satiric intent and was used sincerely by white supremacists to promote racist views. The hijacking of the gesture was so widespread that the Anti-Defamation League added it as a hate symbol in 2019.  ","The OK hand gesture doesn’t have a universal meaning. In Brazil, Greece, Spain, and some Middle Eastern countries, the OK gesture can be seen as obscene. In France, the gesture can mean “worthless.” Those in the many cultures where the OK hand gesture is positive should be mindful of using the OK hand emoji in cross-cultural contexts.

Others have reclaimed the emoji, however, to identify themselves as an immigrant or to express support for causes like DACA.

It might also be used to show an ironic attempt at positivity when things are grim.","Grinning face with smiling eyes emoji was included as part of Unicode 6.0 in 2010 and added to Emoji 1.0 in 2015. In September 2016, Apple released an update to iOS that changed the emoji’s look, making it much more clear that it depicted a happy face. Before then, on iOS this emoji looked very similar to the already existing grimacing face emoji. Other platforms like Facebook and Twitter had this same design issue. This caused the emoji to previously be perceived as a grimace or as something negative due to the design. Because of this, many users have come to think of this emoji as representing awkwardness, discomfort, or displeasure despite its positive name.  This cross-platform graphical difference resulted in ambiguity and some unintended meanings. A person might think they were sending out a happy face, but the recipient might receive a grimace instead. Grimaces are quite far from the feelings that someone who meant to send a grin might want to communicate. In fact, in a study done by Hannah Miller, a researcher at the GroupLens research lab at the University of Minnesota, a person receiving the grinning face with smiling eyes emoji on an Apple device generally perceived it as having a negative sentiment overall. But, the grinning face with smiling eyes emoji is generally very positive in meaning. Today, this emoji is more graphically consistent across platforms than it was in the past, and so its meaning is no longer ambiguous or confused between devices. Since it’s been standardized, on all devices it now has a big grin that radiates genuine joy and happiness.  ","This is the kind of emoji that’s used when a person wants to wish someone a nice day or they want to revel in some positive event happening in their life.

Generally, this emoji is geared toward uses that mirror the ways people use an actual shrug as a communicative tool. Any situation where a person might shrug in real life is a great opportunity to use the person shrugging emoji. An obvious meaning for this emoji is a lack of knowledge. This emoji lets someone shrug in response to a situation in which they don’t have an immediate answer.

This non-sexual interpretation is used more openly and in public than this emoji’s sexual meanings, possibly because the person using it has no idea of its sexual connotations.","The sweat droplets emoji is often used in sexual contexts. It’s usually paired with other emoji that resemble body parts, such as the eggplant emoji and the tongue emoji.

For example, the tongue emoji paired with the sweat droplets emoji could represent oral sex. If it’s got an eggplant emoji to the left of it, this could represent male ejaculation. If it’s with a peach emoji, that might mean anal sex or an attraction to someone’s butt. When this emoji appears out of the context of other sexually-oriented emoji, it can stand in for the concept of ejaculation or arousal, depending on the anatomy of the participants.

In March of 2014, the video artist Jesse Hill “translated” Beyoncé’s hit song “Drunk in Love” into emoji, using the eggplant to represent Jay Z’s penis.        Later that year, the emoji inspired a trend on Instagram and other social-media sites called “#EggplantFriday,” a hashtag that was linked to posts where men posted explicit images of their “eggplants.” But in 2015, Instagram actually blocked the eggplant emoji and references to it (e.g., “#eggplant”) from its search functionality.

In situations where a person might subtweet on Twitter (or tweet negative things about a person without naming that person), they might also use the face without mouth emoji. There’s a sad smugness to this emoji when used in this way. For example, a person might tweet about the frustration they feel when they’re let down by people they prioritize in their life, and end that sentiment with a face without mouth emoji. It doesn’t all have to be bad though. Sometimes, this emoji is used in situations where someone feels like they can’t offer any comments on the situation at hand. Perhaps, they’re literally speechless and post the face without mouth emoji as a reaction to something, either positive or negative. Maybe their favorite musician liked one of their posts on social media. Or, maybe they feel like they’re gabbing too much about something they’re passionate about, so they use the face without mouth emoji to show that they’re putting a lid on it.

This includes situations where they might be asking for a big favor or for advice when they know they’ve gotten themselves into a bad spot. For example, if someone were kicked out of their apartment and needed to humbly ask their friend for a place to stay, they might tack on the face without mouth emoji at the end of their request as a way to indicate that they know they are asking for a big favor.",https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/svg/1f636.svg,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/face-without-mouth-emoji/

290,fire-emoji,🔥, Fire emoji,"The fire emoji is a flame that is mostly yellow with a little red on the top. It is used to signify that something is cool, awesome, exciting, or more colloquially, “on fire.” It can also convey that someone is sexy, (i.e., hot), or refer to other various metaphorical fires.","The fire emoji is also called the flame, hot, or lit emoji. It is commonly used to praise someone or something, signifying that a person, object, album, movie, or so on, is “lit,” a slang term to describe something that is exceptionally cool or great. As lit is also slang for “intoxicated,” the fire emoji doubles as a way to say someone is very high or wasted. The term fire has been used as slang for high-quality weed in hip-hop since the early 1990s, and so sometimes the fire emoji is used to reference marijuana.

Additionally, the fire emoji is a way to express that a person is very attractive, (e.g., “Girl looks   ”). This use is a play on the slang term hot, meaning “sexy” or “really good looking,” and is applied to everyone from one’s boyfriend or girlfriend to celebrities. .@BTS_twt slay America’s Got Talent with IDOL performance 🔥🔥🔥 #BTSonAGT https://t.co/J0pDxcD2Bu — Metro (@MetroUK) September 13, 2018  When paired with other emoji, though, the fire emoji can take on more negative meanings that draw on the literal sense of fire.

291,folded-hands-emoji,🙏, Folded Hands emoji,"The folded hands emoji represents an array of abstract and concrete concepts. Some of these are positive like gratitude, spirituality, and hopefulness. It may also be representative of pleading, asking for something, or desiring an outcome. Some users see it as a high-five on certain devices where only the two hands are shown. On other devices, the entire upper half of a person is visible.","The folded hands emoji looks like hands that might be pressed together for religious prayer and is thus linked to the concepts of spirituality and hopefulness. It’s used in religious, non-religious, and otherwise spiritual contexts. In religious or spiritual contexts, this emoji is accompanied with prayer, sentiments of goodwill, or with reference to a passage in religious scripture. In non-religious contexts, a person might say they’re praying for something too, though they might mean that they’re just strongly hoping for that thing. This emoji can also accompany hopefulness or well wishes. It’s perfect for wishing someone a speedy recovery when they’re injured.  ","Uses of the folded hands emoji include any situation where a person might gesture with their hands together in real life. Like some other emoji, it adds to the conversation by virtue of representing something physical. In Japanese culture (and some other Asian cultures), the gesture of pressing your hands together represents please, thank you, and I’m sorry, in addition to having spiritual associations. Those meanings of the folded hands emoji have also carried over to its use in the West, but here it’s more strongly linked with the religious connotations. Hey, @FastCompany – 🙏 for this!

Someone might say, “You guys are the best friends I’ve ever had.” Then they’d include the folded hands emoji to show just how thankful they are to have those people in their life. Another place it might appear is when someone is asking or begging for something as a visual “please.” They might use this emoji when they’re hoping their favorite band comes to their city. Whatever it is, the folded hands emoji looks a lot like the hands of someone who’s pleading for something. On some devices, this emoji shows up only as two hands touching, whereas on others, it shows up with a person attached to those hands. On their own, the two hands can look like they’re high-fiving. The differences in appearance across platforms have prompted discussion among users as to whether or not they’re praying or high-fiving. People who see them as praying hands point out that when someone prays, their thumbs are on the same side on both hands, whereas it’s the opposite in high-fives. In the end, it’s up to individuals to interpret this emoji for their own uses.

292,goat-emoji,🐐, Goat emoji,"When not alluding to the literal animal, the goat emoji stands for GOAT, an acronym meaning Greatest of All Time. It is generally used in reference to highly skilled individuals, such as award-winning musicians or talented athletes, in order to praise them as being the all-time best in their chosen field. For example, in 2022 quarterback Tom Brady was praised as a GOAT upon his retirement after 22 seasons with the NFL.","The goat emoji is used to signify that someone is highly talented, arguably even the Greatest of All Time. This label is often applied to athletes, and especially to hip-hop stars. GOAT🐐…. Greatest of all time https://t.co/5ihr04n75G — Nana Obiri – Yeboah (@DrNoy45) January 29, 2017  While the acronym GOAT seems to have first appeared in the 1990s, it was not until rapper LL Cool J released his album G.O.A.T. (Greatest of All Time) in 2000 that the term achieved widespread recognition. The album was a huge success, and cemented the now seemingly random connection between worldwide success and the goat emoji. Upon his retirement in 2022, sports fans and media crowned quarterback Tom Brady the GOAT  for his accolades: Brady is a seven-time Super Bowl champion and has been named Super Bowl MVP five times, a feat unmatched by any other player. The title has been similarly used in sports to refer to Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan, and Simone Biles, for example. Not everyone is familiar with the term, however—in 2021, Meryl Streep humorously reported she thought Jonah Hill was comparing her to a farm animal when he called her the GOAT.","The history of GOAT being used to describe athletes owes much of its popularity to Muhammad Ali. He famously used The Greatest of All Time in reference to himself in the 1960s, though only the spelled-out version. He would often shorten this to simply The Greatest.

On social media, the goat emoji is enough to get the statement across without spelling it out. Sometimes GOAT isn’t even stylized as an acronym, which suggests that in certain circles, people are so familiar with this expression that it requires no explanation. This is the case with the 2004 book Goat: A Tribute to Muhammad Ali.  ",https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/svg/1f410.svg,https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/goat-emoji/
